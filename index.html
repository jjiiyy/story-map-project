        <h2>DENMARK</h2>
        <h1>Kommuner Boundaries</h1>
        <p>Denmark, situated in Northern Europe, forms part of the Scandinavian region and is composed of the Jutland Peninsula and over 400 islands, the largest being Zealand, Funen, and Bornholm. Strategically located between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Denmark serves as a vital gateway for trade and cultural exchange in Europe. The country's compact geography, with a coastline stretching over 7,300 kilometers, has historically supported maritime industries, fostering global connections. </p>
        <p>Denmark's urban development reflects a balance between economic growth, sustainability, and quality of life. The capital city, Copenhagen, situated on the island of Zealand, serves as the economic and cultural hub, with a reputation for progressive urban planning, green infrastructure, and smart mobility systems. Key cities such as Aarhus (a hub for education and culture), Odense (known for innovation and history), and Aalborg (a center for industry and logistics) anchor regional development across the country.</p>
        <p>Denmark's urban regions are characterized by mixed-use developments, integrated public transport, and a strong focus on reducing carbon emissions, aligning with its national goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Urban areas are often well-connected to rural landscapes, with green spaces, cycling networks, and waterfront redevelopment projects playing a significant role in shaping modern Danish cities.</p>

        <h2>COPENHAGEN</h2>
        <h1>A City Built For All</h1>
        <p>Copenhagen, as the capital of Denmark, holds immense significance in the global conversation about public realm design and urban development. Recognized as a city designed for all, it exemplifies a human-centered approach to urban planning, where public spaces and building typologies cater to diverse needs, promote social interaction, and ensure accessibility for every resident. Copenhagen seamlessly combines historic charm with cutting-edge, sustainable development, setting benchmarks for cities worldwide.
          The city's success lies in its commitment to creating spaces where people, rather than cars, take priority. It is a place where cycling networks, pedestrian-friendly zones, and green infrastructure collectively form a public realm that enhances livability. Public space typologies in Copenhagen — from waterfront promenades and urban parks to mixed-use neighborhoods — showcase an integrated design philosophy that balances environmental, social, and economic goals. Cities seeking to build better futures can learn invaluable lessons from Copenhagen’s achievements.</p>

        <h2>Copenhagen: A Model for Livable Urban Development</Summary></h2>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>Copenhagen stands as a global exemplar of urban livability, demonstrating how cities can prioritize people, sustainability, and quality of life through thoughtful urban design. By focusing on public space as a shared asset and integrating mixed-use developments, Copenhagen has successfully transformed industrial and underutilized areas into vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods.

          The study of five key developments—Århusgade Quarter, Carlsberg District, Grønttorvet, Sluseholmen, and The Kalvebod—reveals how Copenhagen embraces a consistent yet adaptable approach to urban development:
          
        <p>These developments collectively illustrate Copenhagen's ability to address contemporary urban challenges—such as sustainability, mobility, and inclusivity—while enhancing the quality of life for its residents. The city’s public spaces, cycling infrastructure, and focus on pedestrian-friendly design encourage active lifestyles and reduce car dependency. Moreover, green initiatives, such as urban gardens, energy-efficient buildings, and district heating systems, align with Copenhagen's ambitious goal of becoming the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025.</p>
          
          Copenhagen's success lies in its ability to create spaces that are functional, beautiful, and accessible to all. By prioritizing people over vehicles, nature within the city, and adaptability of spaces, it has set a global standard for urban development. As cities around the world grapple with rapid urbanization and climate change, Copenhagen serves as a model for how the urban realm can be reclaimed, reimagined, and designed to foster a sense of belonging, community, and sustainability.
          
          In studying these five developments, it becomes clear that Copenhagen is not just a city to admire but a living laboratory for the future of urban livability—a place where thoughtful design truly enhances the human experience. </p>
